# Overview   

This repository contains various machine learning models implemented using Python and Scikit-Learn, including:  
1. Data Preprocessing ‚Äì Handling missing values, feature scaling, and encoding.   
2. Supervised Learning ‚Äì Classification and regression using algorithms like Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Trees, and Neural Networks.   
3. Model Evaluation ‚Äì Performance metrics, hyperparameter tuning, and cross-validation.
    
Each project includes notebooks, datasets, and visualization techniques to explore real-world data.
